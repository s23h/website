summary: 'why the self-directed investing boom never really happened, and why most people would rather let BlackRock handle their money than become the next WSB trader.'

our vision for the future of financial markets *was* that increasingly, individual people are going to have profound impacts on markets as people opt to put more and more money into self-directed investments versus managed funds and portfolios. 

the reason for this was primarily led by (1) the power of community and herd mentality in stock trading and picking, (2) the belief and understanding that as a small portfolio, you can be more 'dynamic' when compared to a fund manager with billions under aum and (3) the widespread information and tools now in the palm of retail investors combined with commission free trading. 

(1) still holds. except that same herd lost a lot of money, and learnt a valuable lesson about markets. 

(2) matters more than ever, but conentration risk is only getting worse...(look at how much the s&p 500 is being carried by a select few names). there is fear that ai advice/guidance adds to this risk (i.e. if chatgpt told everyone what stocks it would buy, and everyone listens, that's systemic risk)

(3) is only heightened by ai to help with information processing and consumption

the problem might be demand side. the expected uptick and continued growth of self-directed investment hasn't been as drastic as expected, and has rather seen a blip in people feeling empowered to make their own decisions. etfs and managed portfolios onb the other hand have seen insane growth (cc look at ETF flows + blackrock aum growth). even hering tactics to participation have seen weak uptake (etoro copy trading, social-trading etc). finally, even with the tools available, if people wanted to use these free tools, they could. but they just havent really. part of it comes down to trust, why would I trust this random black box chat bot to tell me where to put my real money. as sota models become more and more impressive, I can see the trust factor for financial advise increasing, but not enough to trump JPM or BlackRock. interestingly, i think i wouldn't mind taking medical advice from llms, but financial is just where there quite simply is not a right answer for stock picking, for the most part, 'it depends'.

i get why self-directed investing is long. it requires a constant view on the market, and to keep up with the endless number of trends. and if you're busy, it's just not high up enough on your radar. i do believe that as work begins to take a smaller % of peoples time, due to global productivity gains in the next 5-7 years, and the amount of free time goes up, a share of this may feed back into meaning self-directed is interesting again. aka i can be bothered. seasonality is also prime. theres a reason the term crypto winter was dubbed, and it comes down to (yet again!) narratives. financial narratives come, explode and then die. 

now. wealth planning. no one wants to think about when they're old and grey, thats the biggest problem with wealth planning (and financial advise in the traditional sense). the inertia is insanely high, and most people can't actually afford financial advice because they don't have enough wealth (>250K in liquid assets).
