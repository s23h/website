the dumb money scale, ranking ways of making money from low iq to high iq. this doesn't mean you can't make money (or even more money) from doing the low iq things, infact often you will make money and even have a better QoL (quality of life) from the low iq stuff, but some people are pretentious, and thats the scale im exploring today.

what does it mean for something to be low iq? a few indicators, it feels like a brain dead activity, it doesn't scale, the people buying the products/services are stupid too (ie do even more low iq work). 

im going to mainly talk about this from the context of entrepreurship versus jobs and employment, but I think that generally speaking the same concepts apply and maybe I'll write a part ii. of course, im talking about this in 2024, where AI is ripping.

## the crème de la crème
#### 1e9 - 1e12 scale
the super scale industries that most people dont understand but benefits people at scale, think OpenAI, Facebook, Apple, Google. The ultimate platform that has made thousands of other people millionaires through their technologies. (People that develop using OpenAI models, sell using Facebook Ads,build apps that are distributed through (and built on) Apple products, and found using Google).  It requires nothing short of sheer genius. These seem obvious, and are actually the less interesting parts of the scale, but the lines start blurring the further down you get. 

## sounds smart but not always
#### 1e6 - 1e9 scale
a lot of infrustucture products interestingly. things like Vercel (an aws lambda wrapper). or Supabase (a postgres wrapper). People will argue these products are way more than this, but they sound smart, and make they save time for a person that believes that they too are high iq ie a developer. Because of this, they can price more and thats why they find themselves much higher up on this list.

## builder enablers
#### 1e6 - 1e9
this is a personal favourite of mine. arguably one of the hardest. building a platform that enables a large number of consumers to jump on the ladder. these ideas of course require a higher level of technical ability to build, but nowhere near the complexity of the ones noted above. examples are things like Replit, Framer, Capcut, Figma etc. They typically leverage other platforms for distributions ie the internet, TikTok, Instagram etc. 

These products come in waves, they tend to stick around for a while but challengers do come. ie before capcut there was premiere pro, and before that there was powerdirector. before framer, there was webflow, and prior to that was wordpress. maybe with cost of software going down, the newer players will be able to interate and stay relevant for longer. but I think there will always be a hot new thing that enables a new wave of people to build stuff. The affiliation to the software is somewhat lower, because the content often lives elsewhere.


## gpt wrappers / indie saas
#### 1e3 - 1e7
i think this is the new web dev/ content agency. complete saas products that can be spun up in hours/days versus weeks/ months. but the people they are selling to for the most part are not technical and saves them precious time or knowledge work. there was previously higher alpha in this, but its coming down (fast!) as people can increasingly interface with higher order products more easily

## web dev or design agencies
#### 1e3 - 1e7
pretty brain dead. figuring out what shiny buttons people will like, learning a platform like Wordpress, Framer or Webflow. 


## content agencies / creators
#### 1e3 - 1e7
brain dead. figuring out what other brain dead people will want to see. producing content (manually) by adding to the thing that makes up over 80% of the internet already. short-lived. and often bought by people that value their time to be higher than making content, or by people who are even more brain dead to figure it out themselves/internally.
