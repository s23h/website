I'm no director, but I do have an interest in filmmaking. For now, nothing earth shattering...just the simple process of capturing moments and creating a body of work as a hobbyist. I specifically choose movie directors because of the layers involved, it captures all the senses from the dialogue, to the score, to the visual canvas, there are so many moving parts. 

Intuitively, I think that CEOs and Directors are cut from the same cloth. To have that level of appreciation for the layers and guiding a team to produce your vision for creation. I am surprised we do not know of more CEOs that take up filmmaking in later life, or even directors that take a shot at being CEO from time to time. It tends to be actors that fill that role. 

Somehow I've gone 2 paragraphs without mentioning AI. I am fascinated by creation, and the bringing to life of ideas. I read an article about 2025 being the year of the "ideas guy", where the journalist interviewed a number of non-technical startup founders (specifically without a technical co-founder.) As a technical co-founder, I am naturally biased, but how can somebody non-technical we the solo co-founder of a *technology* startup. I am not saying it is impossible, but the thought of it becoming the norm sends shivers down my spine. It is far less common in the US than it is in Europe and the UK, that systematically favours (and separates) the business/finance archetype from the technical one, whereas in Silicon Valley, the lines are much more blurred and favours those from a technical background. 

Unlike books, it is actually much easier to judge a startup by its cover, within seconds of going on a website, it is often so easy to make well informed decisions about the company's philosophy to product building. Perhaps they chronically underinvest in UI and brand, and the teams talent is in back-end and processing, or the technologists in the company care deeply about craft and how that is reflected through their product. 

The core beef I have with it is that the motivation doesn't add up to me. This is what I believe (and have experienced to be) the arc of most builders:

- have a problem to solve / an idea to test
- try to solve that problem with things that exist in the market
- hit a roadblock in skill-gap
- try to find someone/some service that will do for them what they need
- realise its too hard, expensive or time consuming to find someone
- figure out how to up-skill to get that thing done
- repeat

So when somebody has a burning desire to work on an idea that may turn into a startup but wants to be "the solo ideas guy", I assume they haven't gone through that arc above. In which case I assume they are too lazy to try, too stupid to figure it out, or not curious enough to have had any problem they cared about up until that point in time... all of which are bad signs. I have no problem with building a knack for working with technical people to build projects for you, it is an incredibly tough thing to do. Either you have a go-to guy, in which case you realise full well how valuable they are to you, or you are a snake whisperer that can do it consistently, in which case you have an *extremely* unique talent.

The opposite is also true, there are technical people that have no (novel) ideas (yes, a new way to discover events is not novel.) They are actually usually just as bad as the ideas guy in terms of suitability to work on a startup, and maybe fell into software engineering as a career path to make money, versus being an actual builder. They equally have not gone through the arc I described above because they are not curious enough to even get to the first step.

In my view, there is no such thing as being the ideas guy. You are either a builder, or you are not. It is not a reflection on your formal education, or your skillset at a point in time. It is a mindset and track record of doing things to solve problems. You don't need to be able to able to deploy a multi-cloud load-balanced cache-optimised SSE-encrypted product to be a builder, you just need to have enough willpower to figure things out for yourself and learn as you go along to find ways to bring your thoughts and ideas to reality. 

This extends to other things too... I often see technical people quickly pickup design, or sales, video editing, stemming from this same mindset and desire of not having roadblocks and intermediaries to getting things done.

And I think the same is true for directors, they are doers and visionaries that have a concept or idea they want to bring to life, and the best ones are the ones that start by doing, by picking up the camera, by writing the script, by doing the edit. 

**This is who AI benefits most, and is the ideal employee for a startup. The future will be run by builders (who happen to leverage AI) to get the things they want done.**
